        <h1>Notepet</h1>
        <p>
          Notepet is a platform for a local animal shelter.
          Before we did this assignment they did there registration on paper.
          After this project that changed to digital and they are working a lot more effecient now.
        </p>

        <p>
          During this project we mainly focused on making it usable for the users.
          We got to know the volunteers (endusers) and tested with them to get to the best results.
          Since most of the volunteers are a bit older and didn't have much experience with technology we made big buttons and clear labels to help them navigate.
        </p>

        <p>
          We build this webapplication in Rails.
          We used Google Maps to show an overview of where they helped animals en the possibilty to export there data to an xlsx.
        </p>

        <p>
          This website is mostly used on mobile so we developed this mobile first to make it work better in that situation.
