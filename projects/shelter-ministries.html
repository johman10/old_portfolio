        <h1>Shelter Ministries</h1>
        <p>
          Shelter Ministries is a organisation that helps foster kids in South Africa.
          They do that by giving them a place to live but also by educating them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I did design and production for the website. I started with selecting colors where I used pictures from the surounding for.
          It really gives an african look to the webite that I'm happy about.
          De tekst in the header shows the visiter directly what Shelter Ministries is standing for.

          This website uses
            <a href="http://modx.com/" target="_blank">
              MODX
            </a>
          as CMS.
          This CMS is pretty cool since it I have all the freedom there is.
          Everything is possible and it's easily expandable by building your own snippets.
          MODX is also very easy to use for content changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          The challange was to make it multilanguage so African people can also read it.
          This website is responsive it is easy to view on a mobile device.
        </p>

          The endresult is at:
            <a href="http://www.shelter-ministries.org/" target="_blank">
              shelter-ministries.org/
            </a>
          .
